Closed 10/12/2015
Reopened 2/1/2016
No information at all on the MTA's press releases, but noticed larged drop in stats from 2014 to 2015. Wikipedia and of all things - a Youtube video that shows the station with the closure sign confirms the dates. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-h-dBGePQY&noredirect=1

Brooklyn
Ditmas Ave F
Manhattan-bound
Closed 6/29/2015
Open Fall 2015?
No information accept noticeable drop in service and mention about continuing work on the Culver line in 2016 - implying that work was already occuring.
